# Foundation-of-Computer-Science
This repository contains diagrams, explanations, and SQL files supporting the Foundation of Computer Science case study on data security, computational complexity, and data normalization.

Task 1: Text Encoding Examples
This task focuses on encoding text manually and programmatically. It includes the study of Hex and Base64 encoding formats.
File: Examples of Encoding Text
Includes:
Manual conversion of text into Hexadecimal encoding.
Manual conversion of text into Base64 encoding.
Sample text files showing the results of these conversions.
Purpose:
Understand how text data can be represented in different encoding formats.
Learn the difference between manual conversion and programmatic approaches.
Usage:
Open the files to view the manual conversions.
Use as examples for learning encoding techniques.

Task 2: Classroom Seating Arrangement Simulation
This task demonstrates simulating seating arrangements in a classroom while following specific constraints.
Files:
seating_arrangement.py – Python source code that implements bruteforce and heuristic approaches for seating arrangements.
sql_script.py – Contains scripts used to measure runtime performance for different seating algorithms.
Features:
Bruteforce approach to generate all possible seating arrangements and measure runtime.
Heuristic approach to generate seating arrangements faster with reduced computation time.
Comparison of runtimes to evaluate efficiency of different algorithms.Purpose:
Understand algorithmic problem solving in Python.
Compare performance of bruteforce and heuristic methods.
Apply practical logic to solve real-world classroom seating constraints.
Usage:
Run seating_arrangement.py in Python 3.x.
The program will output seating arrangements along with the runtime for each approach.

Task 3: Database Management
This task involves creating a normalized database for a college club membership system and performing SQL operations.
Files:
sql_script.py – SQL script to create normalized tables (Student, Club, Membership) with primary and foreign keys.
Inserting_Data.sql – SQL script to insert sample student and club records into the database.
join_operation.sql – SQL script to perform JOIN operations between Student, Club, and Membership tables.
Purpose:
Learn database normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
Perform basic SQL operations like INSERT and SELECT.
Use JOIN queries to fetch combined data such as Student Name, Club Name, and Join Date.
Usage:
Run sql_script.py to create tables and define relationships.
Run Inserting_Data.sql to add initial data.
Run join_operation.sql to fetch combined data using JOIN queries.
